Abstract: "Showers of γ rays and positrons are produced when a high-energy electron beam collides with a superintense laser pulse. We present scaling laws for the electron-beam energy loss, the γ -ray spectrum, and the positron yield and energy that are valid in the nonlinear, radiation-reaction-dominated regime. As an application we demonstrate that by employing the collision of a > GeV electron beam with a laser pulse of intensity >5 × 1021 W cm−2 , today’s high-intensity laser facilities are capable of producing O(104) positrons per shot via light-by-light scattering.""
